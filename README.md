## Installation

### Binary Installation

```bash
# Download latest release
curl -L https://github.com/codechips/srun/releases/latest/download/srun-linux-amd64 | tar xz
chmod +x srun
./srun
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codechips/srun.git
cd srun
./build.sh  # Requires Go 1.21+, Node 18+, pnpm
```

## Usage
```bash
# Start server (default port 8000)
./srun -port=8080

# Environment alternative
SRUN_PORT=8080 ./srun
```

## Process Management (from process_manager.go)
- Job lifecycle management with PID tracking
- Automatic process cleanup on termination
- Context-based cancellation for graceful shutdown
- Status transitions: running → {completed, stopped, failed}
- Restart functionality with command preservation

## Development

To develop locally start the UI server:

```bash
cd ui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then start the Go server:

```bash
go run cmd/srun/main.go
```

In development the calls to the API server are proxied through the Vite dev server. See [vite.config.ts](ui/vite.config.ts).
